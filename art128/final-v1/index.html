                        Yoga and meditation has been a part of my life for over 15 years, and my practice has helped me grow healther mindfully and physically, more flexible and fearless, both on and off the mat. Yoga inspires me to live each moment more mindfully and being aware of myself.

My primary yoga teacher is Barhat Das who has taught yoga for over 40+ years under the tree at Kapiolani park. He taught us the yoga effecting our mind. His teaching was so deep and dedicated .  I completed my 200 hour Ashtanga based  training with Christina Martini who was taught by linage of Ashtanga teachers on Maui.  I will always be a student of the practice and am deeply grateful for the loving wisdom my teachers have shared with me.

In my classes, I love to teach yoga in order to refresh body and mind in the beautiful nature of Hawaii.   creative sequencing, a spirit of playfulness and a dose of inspiration to help you deepen your practice. I seek to help others thrive in live by nurturing body, mind and soul with yoga, and my hope is that you step off the mat feeling refreshed, nourished and balanced.

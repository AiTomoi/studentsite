                        <p>The project requirements were to make a brochure of any type and I chose to create one for an
                            exhibition regarding images of Morocco. I chose to focus upon the architectural elements
                            that make up door and window frames of Morocco with the idea being that as these elements
                            are turned on their hinges to be opened and closed, revealing what is behind, so too are the
                            pages of the brochure. Typeface and margin spacing elements were orchestrated to reference
                            the doors themselves as exotic and mysterious. Pink and blue are common color elements found
                            in Morocco and by incorporating their warm and cool hues, I hoped to show both beginnings
                            and endings, openings and closures, portrayed by the “doors” of pages that are flipped in
                            the brochure. </p>

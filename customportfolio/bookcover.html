                        <p>Project requirements were to listen to three entirely unrelated audiobook stories. They were
                            unrelated by author, by title, and by subject matter. The design of their book covers,
                            however, were to be cohesive and obvious as created in an identifiable style by one singular
                            designer. Contrary to how most books are typically marketed and sold, these three books were
                            not to have any objects or identifiers to their stories used in the development of their
                            covers. In this play on the phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover,” I set out to make
                            designs that would invite readership without actually revealing the book’s contents.
                            Conceptually their design relates to the idea, though that idea may not be directly
                            clarified. The use of a bowling ball and pins, for example, signifies the exponential scale
                            of infection that can result from just one “patient zero” in an epidemic. As traditional
                            printed books are made of paper and bound, so too are the designs as they are devoid of
                            digital creation. Craft paper was used entirely throughout.</p>
